# To actually have your app use this file, you need to RENAME the file to db_credentials.py
# You will find details about your CS340 database credentials on Canvas.

# the following will be used by the db_connector.py and 
# in turn by all the Python code in this codebase to interact with the database

# host = 'classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu'  #DON'T CHANGE ME UNLESS THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY SO
# user = 'cs340_ONID' #CHANGE ME
# passwd = 'super_secret_password' #CHANGE ME
# db = 'cs340_ONID' #CHANGE ME

# host = "127.0.0.1"
# user = "root"
# db = "cs340_zengxi"
# passwd=""

# for server use
host = 'classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu'
